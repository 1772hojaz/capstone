# 🚀 SPACS AFRICA - Quick Start Guide

## What You Have Now

A **complete, production-ready backend** for the SPACS AFRICA platform with:

✅ **Full FastAPI Backend** with ML-powered recommendations  
✅ **PostgreSQL Database** with complete schema  
✅ **Redis Integration** for caching and event-driven architecture  
✅ **Machine Learning Pipeline** (Clustering + Recommendations + Explainability)  
✅ **Background Task Processing** with Celery  
✅ **Docker Configuration** for easy deployment  
✅ **Synthetic Data Generation** for cold-start scenarios  
✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**  

## 🎯 What This App Does

**SPACS AFRICA** helps small traders (street vendors, market stall owners) **team up to buy products in bulk** at wholesale prices, just like big stores do.

### The User Journey

1. **Trader Anna** registers on the app
2. The **ML system** learns her buying patterns (she buys rice weekly)
3. The **clustering algorithm** groups her with similar traders
4. The **recommender engine** suggests: *"Join the Rice Buyers Group - Save 20%!"*
5. Anna sees a **clear explanation**: *"You were grouped with 8 traders who also purchase rice weekly"*
6. She clicks **"Join Group"** and saves money on her next purchase
7. The system **gets smarter** as more traders join and transact

## 🏁 Getting Started (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **Node.js 18+** (for frontend, coming next)
- **4GB RAM** minimum

### Step 1: Start the Backend

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\Audry Ashleen\humphrey

# Start all services with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL database on port **5432**
- Redis on port **6379**
- FastAPI backend on port **8000**
- Celery worker for background tasks
- Celery beat for scheduled tasks

### Step 2: Verify Everything is Running

```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

You should see: `{"status":"healthy", ...}`

### Step 3: View API Documentation

Open your browser and go to:

**http://localhost:8000/docs**

You'll see the interactive **Swagger UI** with all API endpoints.

### Step 4: Create an Admin Account and Generate Data

```bash
# Register an admin user (via API docs or curl)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "full_name": "Test Admin",
    "business_name": "Admin Store"
  }'

# Login to get token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login" \
  -d "username=admin@test.com&password=password123"

# Generate synthetic data (use the token from login)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/generate-synthetic-data" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "num_users": 100,
    "num_transactions": 500,
    "num_groups": 20
  }'
```

### Step 5: Test the ML Pipeline

The synthetic data generation automatically:
1. Creates 100 traders with realistic profiles
2. Generates 500 transactions with purchase patterns
3. Creates 20 bulk-purchase groups
4. Calculates user features for clustering

Now trigger the ML pipeline:

```bash
# Retrain clustering model
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/admin/retrain-clustering" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# This will:
# - Cluster users based on behavior
# - Update user cluster assignments
# - Save the trained model
```

## 🔍 Exploring the System

### View the Database

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
docker exec -it spacs_postgres psql -U spacs_user -d spacs_africa

# Run queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM bulk_groups WHERE status = 'open';
```

### View Logs

```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Celery worker logs
docker-compose logs -f celery

# All logs

```

### Stop Everything

```bash
docker-compose down

# Or to also remove volumes (data)
docker-compose down -v
```

## 🧪 How the ML Works

### 1. **Clustering Module** (`clustering.py`)

- **What it does**: Groups traders with similar buying behavior
- **Algorithm**: K-Means clustering
- **Features used**:
  - Purchase frequency (how often they buy)
  - Average transaction value
  - Price sensitivity (preference for bulk deals)
  - Location
  - Product diversity

**Example clusters**:
- "High-Frequency Urban Buyers" - Buy often, city-based
- "Price-Conscious Rural Traders" - Focus on discounts
- "Bulk-Focused Wholesalers" - Buy large quantities

### 2. **Recommender Engine** (`recommender.py`)

- **What it does**: Suggests groups for traders to join
- **How it works**:
  1. Finds traders in the same cluster
  2. Identifies products they commonly buy
  3. Suggests existing open groups
  4. Proposes new group opportunities

**Scoring logic**:
- High score if user has bought the product before
- Bonus for recent purchases
- Considers group fill rate (sweet spot: 30-80% full)
- Factors in discount percentage

### 3. **Explainability Module** (`explainability.py`)

- **What it does**: Translates ML outputs into human language
- **Examples**:
  - ❌ Bad: "Cluster 3, Score: 0.87"
  - ✅ Good: "You were grouped with 8 traders who also purchase rice weekly"

**Template system**:
- Different explanations based on context
- Considers user history, location, category affinity
- Always shows "why" prominently

## 🎨 Next Steps: Frontend

The backend is **100% complete**. To finish the full stack application:

### Option 1: I can build the frontend for you

The frontend will include:
- **React + TypeScript** with Material-UI
- **PWA features** (offline mode, installable)
- **Trader Dashboard** with recommendations
- **Admin Dashboard** with charts and metrics
- **Service Worker** for offline functionality

### Option 2: You can connect your own frontend

Use the API endpoints documented at `/docs`. The backend is fully functional and ready to use.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Find and kill process using port 8000 (Windows PowerShell)
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process

# Or change the port in docker-compose.yml
```

### Database Connection Error

```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker-compose ps postgres

# Restart the database
docker-compose restart postgres
```

### Can't Generate Synthetic Data

Make sure products exist in the database first. The `init.sql` seeds 8 products automatically.

### Redis Connection Error

```bash
# Check if Redis is running
docker-compose ps redis

# Restart Redis
docker-compose restart redis
```

---

## 🎯 Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. Register a Trader

```bash
POST /api/auth/register
{
  "email": "trader1@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "full_name": "Anna Mwangi",
  "business_name": "Anna's Corner Shop",
  "location_name": "Nairobi, Kenya"
}
```

### 2. Generate Data (Admin)

Creates realistic ecosystem with 100 traders.

### 3. Run Clustering

Assigns traders to behavioral clusters.

### 4. Generate Recommendations

```bash
POST /api/recommendations/generate
```

### 5. View Recommendations

```bash
GET /api/recommendations
```

You'll see personalized group suggestions with explanations!

### 6. Join a Group

```bash
POST /api/groups/{group_id}/join
{
  "group_id": "...",
  "quantity_committed": 10
}
```

### 7. Check System Metrics (Admin)

```bash
GET /api/admin/evaluation
```
