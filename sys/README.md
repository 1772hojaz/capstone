sys directory
=============

Contains deployment scripts, backend and frontend subprojects, and administrative artifacts for the system.

- `backend/` – Python backend service
- `frontend/` – React frontend

Ignore local development artifacts (virtualenvs, node_modules, build) — these are listed in `.gitignore`.
