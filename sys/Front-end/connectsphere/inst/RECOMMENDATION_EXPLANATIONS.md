  ✓ You viewed 3 similar keyboards last week
  ✓ Popular among tech enthusiasts in New York
  ✓ Price matches your budget ($50-$150)

</div>
```

**After**: "Here are products specifically chosen for YOU, and here's why"

This builds trust, increases engagement, and makes the ML system feel intelligent and helpful rather than opaque and mysterious.

**Result**: Higher click-through rates, more group joins, and happier users who feel understood. 🎯
